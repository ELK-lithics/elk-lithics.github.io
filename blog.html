                    <p>I've been digging on an exciting site the name, location etc. of which I can not reveal. Nevertheless its a great dig where we've been making a lot of very interesting finds.</p>

                    <p>After becoming an official volunteer with the Saxony-Anhalt State Department of Archaeology, I went on a fieldwalk around the city of Naumburg in Central Germany.</p>
                    <p>Although a collegue and I were searching for older material, this beautiful Neolithic arrowhead caught my eye. This leaf-shaped style, although common in the UK and typically associated with the Early Neolithic, is a very rare form in Germany and likely dates to the Middle Neolithic.</p>

                    <h2>April 2nd-5th, 2024</h2>
                    <p>In early April, a friend of mine and I visited the Hugo Obermaier conference, which had the topic of "Alpha and Omega, the emergence and disappearance of Middle Palaeolithic lifeways". The conference was held a few clicks south of our university, in the very picturesque Weimar.</p>
                    <p>The conference focused primarily on Middle and Upper Palaeolithic archaeology from around the globe, which was very eye-opening as I had minimal interaction with archaeology from these periods prior.</p>
                    <p>It was a very enjoyable experience and gave us the possibility to connect with fellow researchers and students.</p>
                    <p>A highlight of the conference was a day-long excursion visiting several Upper Palaeolithic cave sites around Thuringia. My favourite of these was the Ilsen cave, situated literally underneath the medieval Ranis castle. The cave's size is immense, something that can't be conveyed with the photo (left) taken with my phone.</p>

                    <h2>March 21st, 2024</h2>
                    <p>Today, I visited Guildford Museum to examine some finds discovered by various hobby collectors and antiquarians within my research area.</p>
                    <p>Among the collections was this group of unprovenanced Barbed and Tanged arrowheads, collected by hobbyist Henry Albert Mangles in the 1890s.</p>
                    <p>Unfortunately, as was common at the time, very little is provenanced. At most, one can expect a parish name or county to have been inked onto the artefactsâ€”only 33% of Mangles' collection includes such information.</p>
                    <p>Regardless, it was a really insightful trip, and the collection contained many fascinating lithics, some of which were provenanced to my research area.</p>
